	Discussing problems or any aspect of problem, on any other platform on the

	test data. However output and input<br />should be exactly as specified in
	the samples provided.<br />● If anyone is using code from some other source
	in his submission, he should provide<br />proper attribution. Failing this,

	the contest on a single problem<br />will be limited to 500.<br />● If you
	are using any other online development environment, make sure that other<br />contestants
	don't have access to your code. As a contestant, you are responsible
	for<br />making sure others don't access the code that you submit.

	(not secret).<br /><strong>Judging Criteria:</strong><br /><br />● All the
	problems have same points allotted to them.<br />● Users are ranked
	according to the most problems solved. Ties will be broken by the<br />total
	time for each user in ascending order of time.<br />● The total time is the
	sum of the time consumed for each problem solved. The time<br />consumed for
	a solved problem is the time elapsed from the beginning of the contest to<br />the
	submission of the first accepted run plus 20 penalty minutes for every
	previously<br />rejected run for that problem(Wrong answer, Time limit
	exceeded, Runtime Error). There<br />is no time consumed for a problem that
	is not solved.<br />● The decision of the organizers in declaring the
